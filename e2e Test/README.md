# End 2 end Testing 

- I wrote 10 e2e test cases for App4Test.
- 9 test cases cover normal execution and 1 test case covers a failed login.
- I used selenium to navigate through the web pages
- A total of 13 screenshots are saved during tests. (See them in e2e Test/Screenshots)
- I used class methods setUpClass and tearDownClass to initialise and revert the testing environment.
- I mainly tested the alert messages and the changes in the main table at productapp.html.
- A temporary user and product were created during testing.
