# App 4 Software Testing & DevOps Pipeline

- This is a small python application that I made to try on 4 types of software testing and a DevOps pipeline.
- The user login then manages products (CRUD). He can buy a product or get the price average.
- I used sqlite3 for the database. It was initialised with databaseinit.py.
- In each folder you will find one level of testing with its Readme file:
    1. Unit testing
    2. Integration testing
    3. E2E testing
    4. UAT

### Execution:
