# Unit Testing 

- I wrote 9 test cases for 4 methods of App4Test.
- Each test contains 3 steps: 
    1. #Given
    2. #When
    3. #Then
- I used assertEquals and assertRaises to test the average function.
- I used patch and mocked object to test fetch_by_name by controlling sqlite3 return values.

### Test Execution:

- The 9 tests are Ok.
