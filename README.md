# App 4 Software Testing  

- This is a small python application that I made to try on 4 levels of software testing.
- The user login then manages products (CRUD). There is also an "average price" and a "buying product" functionalitiy.
- I used sqlite3 for the database. It was initialised with databaseinit.py.
- In each folder you will find one level of testing with its Readme file:
    1. Unit Tests
    2. //
    3. //
    4. //

### Execution:
