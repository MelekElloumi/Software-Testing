# Unit Testing 

- I wrote 17 test cases for 10 methods of App4Test, from loginModule and productModule.
- Each test contains 3 steps: 
    1. Given
    2. When
    3. Then
- I used assertEquals and assertRaises to test the average function.
- I used patch and mocked objects to test database functions by controlling sqlite3 return values.

### Test Execution:
